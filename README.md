# NodePop 0.2

A Rest API to learn coding

## Demo

You can find the last version of this API running at: [http://nodepop.antoniomasia.com](http://nodepop.antoniomasia.com)

The API is running behind an Nginx inverse proxy which also serves all app's static resources, like ad's images or css files, through HTTP port 80.

You can call the HTTP method GET /apiv1/ads to get a list of all test ads stored in the database. Each ad has an associated image stored in the virtual path /images/ads to test static files retrieving, for example:

Remeber to first get authenticated by calling HTTP method POST /apiv1/login, informing body keys email and password in the HTTP request (see sample user credentials below). To inform the access token in every API call, use header key x-access-token in the HTTP request or directly by url param.

`http://nodepop.antoniomasia.com/apiv1/ads?token=YOURTOKEN`

## Instalation

DB_NAME = 'nodepop'
PORT = 3000

# Security config
JWT_SECRET = 'yoursecret'
JWT_EXP_TIME = 10
JWT_EXP_UNIT = 'd'
HASH_SALT = 10

# Test database install scripts
FILE_DATA = './test_data/test_data.json'
COLLECTION_NAME = 'ads'

# E2E test
TOKEN_TEST = 'token'
```

Finaly you must reset the database. Yo can do it running the next command:

`npm run dBreset`
